# Medical-NER
I had to present a demo for Named Entity Recognition NER on Medical text Data. I found [Stanza](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/biomed_model_usage.html) NLP Package suitable for my task but I was not able to integrate it with Spacy Displacy to show highlighted Entities. So I created this little script for the demo.
